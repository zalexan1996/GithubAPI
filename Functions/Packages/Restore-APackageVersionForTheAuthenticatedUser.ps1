.SYNOPSIS
Restores a package version owned by the authenticated user.
You can restore a deleted package version under the following conditions:
The package was deleted within the last 30 days.
The same package namespace and version is still available and not reused for a new package. If the same package namespace is not available, you will not be able to restore your package. In this scenario, to restore the deleted package, you must delete the new package that uses the deleted package's namespace first.
To use this endpoint, you must authenticate using an access token with the packages:read and packages:write scopes. If package_type is not container, your token must also include the repo scope.

        
.PARAMETER accept
Setting toapplication/vnd.github.v3+json is recommended.
         
.PARAMETER package_type
The type of supported package. Can be one of npm, maven, rubygems, nuget, docker, or container. Packages in GitHub's Gradle registry have the type maven. Docker images pushed to GitHub's Container registry (ghcr.io) have the type container. You can use the type docker to find images that were pushed to GitHub's Docker registry (docker.pkg.github.com), even if these have now been migrated to the Container registry.
         
.PARAMETER package_name
The name of the package.
         
.PARAMETER package_version_id
Unique identifier of the package version.
